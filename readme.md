# Cafe webpage

## This cafe webpage consists of several parts (header, nav, main, footer and l-fix). It provides information (prices, pictures and brief descriptions) about 4 types of coffee. 

## The words in the nav part will turn yellow when hovered with the cursor.

# Romantic memory webpage

## This romantic memory webpage is adapted from the above cafe webpage. The function of this webpage is to record good time with photos. On the left you may put 5 big photos, while on the right you may put 21 small photos. In Chinese, 5 sounds like "I", 2 sounds like "love", and 1 sounds like "you". That is why those numbers are used. You may use your own photos; the photos of Pikachu, Chenqianqian, etc. are only to give a demonstration.

## The background is falling cherry blossoms, because they are romantic and beautiful. The background is adapted by: https://codepen.io/alphardex/pen/dyPorwJ .  [Copyright (c) 2020 by alphardex.
